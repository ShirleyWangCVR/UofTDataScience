# JSC370 A1: Scientific Impact of Nobel Prize Winning Papers

Among Nobel Prize winners in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, what is the relationship between scientific impact of a paper and the timing of the paper during a scientist's career? Does this relationship depend on a scientist's age, gender, team size, or prize category? For this report I will be examining these questions by conducting regression analysis to see if there are any significant relationships found, and if there are any evident confounders from the other variables.
