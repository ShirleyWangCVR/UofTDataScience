# JSC370 A2: Liver Cancer Patient Subtypes and their Respective Survival Rates 

Are there distinct biological "subtypes" of patients with liver cancer that have different survival times? What impact does age at diagnosis, tumor stage, and sex have on the relationship between survival and subgroup? For this report, I will be using hierarchical clustering to find subtypes of patients through their gene counts, and then conducting survival regression to see differences in survival and what factors have a significant effect on survival within the subgroups.
