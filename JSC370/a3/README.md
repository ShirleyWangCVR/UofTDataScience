# JSC370 A3: 

This was a group project done by me and Tao Sun.

The project was to create an interface to assist with UofT librarians in their analysis of which journals to subscribe to.  The data is confidential under publishing liscence.  We created interactive widgets to display the most downloaded journals, some statistics about what journals were downloaded, and a predictive model to predict future downloads.

The following instructions are for if you do have access to the data.

## Getting the Data

1. Download "Web of Science data UofT affiliated pubs 2014-2018.zip" and "JSC370 Data KM.zip"
2. Unzip both into the same folder
3. In JSC370 Data KM, delete the _MACOSX folder
4. Collapse the JSC370 Data KM/JSC370 Data KM folder into just JSC370 Data KM
