# JSC370 A4: Improving the Quality of Urban Life

This was a group project done by me and Mingwei (Yuka) Xu.

The goal of Sidewalk Labs Toronto is to be able to improve urban life, and to achieve that they are observing how people interact with the environment on a daily basis through the use of Numina sensors. In this notebook we have created some tools that will hopefully be helpful in the analysis of how people interact with the environment and give further insights into what sort of changes should be made to make life better for people who pass through the area.

The data for this analysis comes from Numina from Sidewalk Labs.  To access it you need access credentials for them.
