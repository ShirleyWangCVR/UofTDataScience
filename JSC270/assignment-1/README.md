# JSC270 A1: Change in Global Life Expectancy and Possible Correlating Factors

In this report, we will investigate if global life expectancy has changed between 2013 and 2018, and if there are specific factors that are associated with these results. We are using the CIA Factbook data available on the CIA Factbook website in this report. We will answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Has global life expectancy at birth changed between 2013 to 2018? Which continents and countries have experienced the least and greatest changes?
2. Use data from the 2013 and 2018 World Factbook to investigate if a countries' health expenditures and carbon dioxide emissions from consumption of energy are associated with life expectancy at birth. Create categorical variables using health expenditures and carbon dioxide emissions. Do your results change?
3. Answer 2, except this time choose two other variables (i.e., not health expenditure or carbon dioxide emissions) from the CIA World Factbook to investigate if these variables are associated with life expectancy at birth. We will use Infant Mortality and External Debt.
