# JSC270 A2: Yelp Business Types and Relationships

In this report I will analyze the Yelp dataset and use it to investigate the cities and most popular business types on Yelp. I will investigate what kind of businesses tend to have bike parking, and if reviews are correlated with ratings. I will also investigate Canadian businesses and businesses in the Greater Toronto Area specifically, and analyze Tim Hortons and Starbucks distances and reviews.

The dataset itself is from the Yelp Dataset Challenge, and is too large for github.
