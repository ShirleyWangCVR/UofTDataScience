# JSC270 A3: Optimizing Parking in Municipalities

This was a group project done by me and David Goldstein.

As North American cities grow larger in size and in opportunity, so too does the problem of finding parking in the busy downtown core of any such city. Anyone who has had to drive somewhere downtown has faced the age old problem of reaching their destination and then not finding anywhere to park. The problem extends much further than the frustration of drivers who've reached their destination. Drivers searching for parking tend to circle around downtown blocks, which contributes to traffic congestion, and in turn makes it even more difficult and time consuming to find parking. Estimates state that on average, American drivers spend 17 hours a year searching for parking. Furthermore, this time lost comes at a monetary cost to both drivers and businesses in the vicinity, as productivity is adversely affected and clients of businesses think twice about driving in.

In this report, we hope to provide further insight into the problem of finding parking in cities. We hope to build up an understanding of the problem, and attempt to identify a number of potential factors contributing to the problem in order to provide potential recommendations that may be further explored.

## Note:

The data comes from Geotab Bigquery.  To access it you will need access to Geotab's dataset.  In order to run our code, you'll need to generate your own credentials file and modify the table names in any query to reflect those on your bigquery account.

Also, we used some google maps visualizations, and those did not render on github for some reason (Likely because we have satellite mode on). You'll have to run the code to get them to work. We realized this a bit too late and didn't add static images to the data analysis plan! Sorry!
